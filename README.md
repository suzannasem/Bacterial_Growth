# Bacterial Growth
This report applies an optimal control approach to model the optimal amount of chemical nutrient to add to a bacteria population to maximize population growth and minimize chemical usage. The chemical also produces a byproduct that hinders growth, and this byproduct has a stronger effect on smaller populations.

## Structure
In the "Full_Report.md" file, you'll find my entire typeset report, including images and equations.
.png files with the "m1" title are figures generated for this project.
In the "MATLAB" section, you'll find the MATLAB code I used to generate figures for the report. I used the Runge-Kutta 4 forward-backward sweep method to numerically estimate each graph because the differential equations we produced were impossible to solve analytically.
